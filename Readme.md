Imai, Masami, and Seitaro Takarabe. 2011. ["Bank Integration and Transmission of Financial Shocks: Evidence from Japan." American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 3 (1): 155-83. ](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.3.1.155)


In late 1991 Japan underwent a land price bubble collapse which effected the nation-wide economy significantly. There are many macro-economic research papers that try to determine how this financial shock spread across borders. One on side it is argued that the large, diversified banks are partly immune to idiosyncratic errors which is advantageous against a financial shock. However, on the other hand during a land price crisis the value of collaterals depreciate and therefore worsen their creditworthiness. Consequently, the bank might shift capital away from the effected market to the safer ones, hence increasing the volatility and the degree of the crisis.

The aim of the following paper is to explore whether and to what extent the banking integration contributed to transmit the Japanâ€™s nationwide financial shock between 1980 and 2003 (by using data on branch network of large city banks and the land prices of the commercial sites for each prefecture and major city).
